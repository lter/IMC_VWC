LTER Lead PIs - Data Management - IMPORTANT<BR><BR><B>Attachments:</B> EB Data

Lead-PIs-<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This summer NSF expressed to me what was described as 
a serious concern about site-level data accessibility that is beginning to be 
reflected in panel discussions and site reviews. The general concern is that 
LTER data availability and access appear to be oversold and inconsistent among 
sites. The specific concerns are that - at the site level - core and signature 
data sets are often difficult to locate, that tracing ownership of datasets to 
PIs is often impossible, that file names are uninformative, and that data sets 
and documentation are often out of date. NSF program officers emphasized that 
they are referring to accessibility of actual data, not metadata, which appear 
to be in excellent shape. Program officers asked the Network for a response in 
time to inform 2009 site reviews.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to this 
request the EB charged an EB subcommittee to review all web sites in the network 
and to recommend potential solutions for sites to implement in advance of their 
midterm site reviews and renewals. The review revealed that these problems are, 
in fact, widespread. To a large extent the immediate issues are related to 
presentation and functionality at the site level: data catalogs can be hard to 
get to, are rarely organized by core area or consistent variate categories, and 
often search terms are so narrow that searches can lead to the impression that 
key data are missing. More detail appears in EB minutes for those 
interested.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; After considerable discussion within the 
EB and follow-on discussion with NSF, last week the EB approved a best-practices 
data presentation format for sites to adopt to meet NSF's data concerns and 
(more importantly) to improve site-level data access within the network. The aim 
is to achieve first-step functionality for cross-site data discovery. We believe 
these first-step guidelines will be relatively straightforward for sites to 
implement, though not without some effort. The approved guidelines are 
consistent with the CI portion of the decadal plan, for which NISAC is 
developing an implementation strategy. Your information manager may also already 
be familiar with a 2005 Network recommendation for LTER web design (<A 
href="http://intranet.lternet.edu/im/files/im/web_design_rec8.pdf"> 
http://intranet.lternet.edu/im/files/im/web_design_rec8.pdf</A>).<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Important Note: </B>Because these guidelines were developed to address concerns 
raised by NSF, they are likely to be used in NSF site evaluations. I have 
discussed with Henry that it may take some sites more time than is available 
before the next set of midterm reviews, and he said that he would keep this in 
mind when developing CI expectations for the review teams.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; 
BTW, no sites are currently compliant – all of us need to pay attention to this, 
though some more than others. A generic example page is attached that should be 
useful.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know if 
questions.....<BR>Phil<BR>&nbsp;<BR>----------------------------------------------------------<BR>Recommendations 
(also in attachment):<BR>1. On the site's home page provide a direct link to the 
data catalog, prominently displayed as a one-click url.<BR>2. On the topmost 
data page:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. identify signature data sets 
that best represent the site's research goals;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
b. provide a capability to search datasets by LTER core area, by PI ownership, 
and by keyword (PI ownership refers to the PI or co-PI responsible for the data, 
not just the staff responsible for collecting and 
posting);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. provide a capability to browse 
datasets by LTER core areas;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. provide a 
prominent link to the LNO MetaCat system (the Network-wide database of 
metadata);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. provide a prominent link to 
network-wide databases (ClimDB, HydroDB, SiteDB); 
and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. provide a prominent link to 
EcoTrends.<BR><BR>In addition, NISAC is being charged with considering a plan 
for implementing longer-term recommendations: a) within metadata files, 
including a link to the data tables described; and b) address data access 
tracking, a controlled keyword vocabulary, and a units 
dictionary.<BR></BODY></HTML>
