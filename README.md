Virtual Water Cooler meeting notes for IMC

2019-08-15 Meeting notes from old im.lternet.edu have been tranfered to the folder im.lternet.files. The files were named with their original upload date. All attachments are stored in the folder `attachments`. That means that links in the pdf files don't work but the file names they are referring to are still the same.
