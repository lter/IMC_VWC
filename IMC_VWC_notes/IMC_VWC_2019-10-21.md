**Topic:** Margaret O'Brien answered questions about EML 2.2 during this water cooler.

### New features people plan to use soon'ish

- Attribute annotation 
- dataset annotation
- Funding
- Markdown in text elements
- Units
- Taxonomic IDs
  + ITIS
  + Worms
  + Algae-base

### Summary of questions that have action items

Q. When will assemblyLine support 2.2?

A. January 2020 (per Colin)

Q. OBOE is the one that I couldn't find a search portal for and has terms like "containsMeasurementsOf"

A. Write a how to page, with DEFAULTS

Q. KNB validator occasionally (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/emlparser/)

A. Install the EML 2.2 validator. Write a tutorial on how to validate (multiple methods). More important with annotations, to validate refs.

Q. Markdown: When will it be processed?

A. Need a preprocessor (Mark Servilla)

Q. Units: Where is the simple Units List for EML 2.2?

A. Create one!

Q. Units: Will the LTER Unit registry keep up?

A. Revisit this, update with 2.2 content

Q. From Li, later: Example root element has a typo

A. Repair originals, export new one to PDF, to Susanne to post

Q. What taxon services to expect

A. The ones supported by the rOpenSci taxize package:

- Currently supported APIs (pre John):
- Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) eol
- Taxonomic Name Resolution Service tnrs
- Integrated Taxonomic Information Service (ITIS) itis
- Global Names Resolver (from EOL/GBIF) gnr
- Global Names Index (from EOL/GBIF) gni
- IUCN Red List iucn
- Tropicos (from Missouri Botanical Garden) tp
- Theplantlist.org tpl
- Catalogue of Life col
- National Center for Biotechnology Information ncbi
- CANADENSYS Vascan name search API vascan
- International Plant Names Index (IPNI) ipni
- World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) worms
- Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) bold
- Pan-European Species directories Infrastructure (PESI) pesi
- Mycobank myco
- National Biodiversity Network (UK) nbn
- Index Fungorum fg
- EU BON eubon
- Index of Names (ION) ion

### Notes copied from zoom chat here

From Stace to Everyone:
  When will assemblyLine support 2.2?
  January 2020

From M. Gastil-Buhl to Everyone: (12:11 PM)
  Do you want to see the schemaSpy for Sem Annot in core metabase? I could screen share. ENVO and ECSO, oboe 

From An to Everyone: (12:15 PM)
  OBOE is the one that I couldn't find a search portal for and has terms like "containsMeasurementsOf" 

From M. Gastil-Buhl to Everyone: (12:15 PM)
  example: http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00000639 uri for containsMeasurementOf is "http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe/oboe.1.2/oboe-core.owl#containsMeasurementsOfType 
  From M. Gastil-Buhl to Everyone: (12:22 PM)
  ENVO is the vocabulary which has incorporated LTER Controlled Vocabulary, right Margaret? 

From An to Everyone: (12:45 PM)
  sorry - what list is this? I do use the KNB validator occasionally 

From stevan to Everyone: (12:50 PM)

From An to Everyone: (12:50 PM)
  also - if you use the R package EML - the function `emld::eml_validate()` does check for schema validity. Not sure if it checks referential integrity I forgot to mention, above function does check for eml 2.2 atm 

From Stace and Jaxine @ NES to Everyone: (12:53 PM)
  Thanks! We at NES are presently interested in the attribute annotation, taxon id's, and UDunits, thanks
